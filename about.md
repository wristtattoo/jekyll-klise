> Being curious, interested in users behavior and looking to understand the reasons behind users actions. Observing and inquiring eventually to create a solution. Thinking in needs, not features. Being open-minded, listening and empathising. Savouring the process of trying to understand the "why" behind the problem and studying the situation and not putting the solution before the problem ~ Terry
