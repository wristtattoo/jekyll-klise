> A catch-all term for most user testing methods. A/B testing does have its own advantages, however, and provides a great supplement to qualitative studies. Simply, you don't know why you get the measured results as your not directly observing the users or gaining insights to their thoughts.

> Quantitative research can help capture real-time activities in the workplace and point toward what needs attention.

> Qualitative Research is about capturing people’s changing opinions and emotions at the touchy-feely end of the spectrum therefore the basis of empathic understanding how people perceive and do things.
Qualitative research can be concentrated and more targeted to gather meaningful data. This method of research are not bound by the limitations of quantitative ‘bean-counting' methods.
