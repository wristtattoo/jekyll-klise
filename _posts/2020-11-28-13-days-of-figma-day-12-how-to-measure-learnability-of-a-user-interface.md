>  Information enters the memory system implicitly (i.e. without conscious effort or awareness), and this process can have a considerable effect on our memory for visual scenes. Research suggests that information relevant to our current activities can seep into our memory system and improve recognition. If information on the periphery can influence memory in such a way, there is obvious and significant potential to improve the memorability of all things within our products by increasing the relevancy of information and contents. ~ UX and Memory: Present Information at Relevant Points.
