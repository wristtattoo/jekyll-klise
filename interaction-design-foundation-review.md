## Review of the Interaction Design Foundation UX Community

[Interaction Design Foundation](https://www.interaction-design.org/courses){:title="IxDF"}{:alt="IxDF"} offers a vast amount of knowledge written by concurrent interaction design experts and academics validated by industry leaders, delivered to us in palatable self-paced lessons. [Live and on-demand webinars presented by design leaders](https://www.interaction-design.org/master-classes){:title="Link to Master Classes"}{:alt="Link to Master Classes"} have also been a benefit to compliment their courses and knowledge covered. I was blessed to have started my professional Interaction Design career in the internet boom of 1995 after graduating at BA Hons Degree level later taking a Design Masters Degree 10 years after. [IxDF](https://www.interaction-design.org/courses){:title="IxDF"}{:alt="IxDF"} fill the postgraduate void that i have missed and want to remain part of.

 [UX Design Courses by Interaction Design Foundation](https://www.interaction-design.org/courses){:title="UX Design Courses by Interaction Design Foundation"}{:alt="UX Design Courses by Interaction Design Foundation"} have validated my knowledge in creating and enhancing UI designs for efficiency and persuasion based on principles of human cognition and taught me how to evaluate the user experience of a design through correct user tests and evaluation. In practise i have produced and executed ux strategies that ensures all UX work across my organisation that is aligned with business values, such as customer needs, are slowly embedding into the company culture, thus growing internal UX maturity.

Earning up to date course certificates to verify that i have completed courses have been an honour receive and display. [The Interaction Design Foundation UX Community](https://www.interaction-design.org/courses){:title="Interaction Design Foundation UX Community"}{:alt="Interaction Design Foundation UX Community"} continue to provide invaluable knowledge through new courses, webinars from industry leaders and hold the world's largest authoritative library of [open-source UX Design literature](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics){:title="UX Design literature"}{:alt="UX Design literature"} to reference. 

These are a few reasons why i joined the [Interaction Design Foundation UX Community](https://www.interaction-design.org/courses){:title="Interaction Design Foundation UX Community"}{:alt="Interaction Design Foundation UX Community"} and return frequently to continue learning. Thank you IxDF üôèüèª
