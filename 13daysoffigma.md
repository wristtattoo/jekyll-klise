> Joined by some physical connection, law of element connectedness comes into play here. Design can exploit the grouping laws, such as element connectedness, to influence our perception of physical or graphical objects. This is particularly important when presenting users with large numbers of items at once.

> It is my role to understand and care about different user needs including those with visual, speech, auditory, physical or cognitive disabilities. Usability is about designing products to be efficient and satisfying usable by everyone regardless of age, ability and circumstance. Empathy towards the user is also a key principle. Interaction design is driven by a human connection and users are vital to the design process.. ~ Terry

> Empathic design is a consideration of how the end-user will use what is being designed. Exposing a project to empathy design early on in UX gains valuable feeback potentially saving hours of development time. UX is an approach to design and development that focuses on the context of use for the solution designed and having empathy of the end-users of a product, service, or system in order to improve the quality of the final solution. Empathy design has proven essential in my experience. ~ Terry

> If you can not reduce the choice, at least hide less popular options. It’s not just about the number of choices but about how distinct those choices are from one another. Hicks Law shows us that the more choices we offer a user, the longer it will take for them to decide, so increasing the chance they abandon the process. ~ Terry
