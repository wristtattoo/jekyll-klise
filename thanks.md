`El Madrid, it's nice to see ya`
`It's really nice to be here`
`I love you all`

`Stale beer, fat nuts, smoked out, cowpokes`
`Sequined mountain ladies`
`I love you all`

`Put your arms around me,`
`Fiddly digits, itchy britches`
`I love you all`

`I love you all`
`I love you all`
`I love you all`

`Washrooms smell, they could be cleaner`
`Stench of cigarettes and stale urea`
`I love you all`

`Prodigal son waits to return`
`To where the dogs play pool`
`I love you all`
