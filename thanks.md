El Madrid, it's nice to see ya<br>
It's really nice to be here<br>
I love you all<br>

Stale beer, fat nuts, smoked out, cowpokes<br>
Sequined mountain ladies<br>
I love you all<br>

Put your arms around me,<br>
Fiddly digits, itchy britches<br>
I love you all<br>

I love you all<br>
I love you all<br>
I love you all<br>

Washrooms smell, they could be cleaner<br>
Stench of cigarettes and stale urea<br>
I love you all<br>

Prodigal son waits to return<br>
To where the dogs play pool<br>
I love you all<br>

I love you all<br>
I love you all<br>
I love you all<br>

I love you all<br>

I love you all<br>
I love you all<br>
I love you all<br>
I love you all<br>
I love you<br>
I love you all<br>
I love you<br>
I love you<br>
I love you all<br>
I love you all
